# A Personal Mood Tracker

MindMood is a simple, visual mood logger designed to help you reflect on your emotional patterns over time. Inspired by GitHub's contribution graph, this app lets you log your daily mood and a short note, and visualizes it in a colorful heatmap.
It also acts as a no-framework vanilla webdev practice.
